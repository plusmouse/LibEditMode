# LibEditMode

Modify anchors and settings of frames controlled by edit mode _without_
triggering taint issues or requiring a `/reload`.

```lua
local LibEditMode = LibStub("LibEditMode-1.0")
LibEditMode:LoadLayouts()
LibEditMode:ReanchorFrame(MainMenuBar, "TOP", UIParent)
LibEditMode:ApplyChanges()
```

# Usage

## Initialization and saving

need to call this again if the edit mode UI updates the layouts.

### `LibEditMode:AreLayoutsLoaded()`

Has `LibEditMode:LoadLayouts()` been called at some point?

during combat.

### `LibEditMode:SaveOnly()`

## Frame configuration

### `LibEditMode:ReanchorFrame(frame, ...)`

same parameters as a `frame:SetPoint(...)` call for the anchor.
